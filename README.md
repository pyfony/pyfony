# Pyfony framework

Pyfony is a **Dependency Injection (DI) powered framework** written in Python greatly inspired by the [Symfony Framework](https://symfony.com/) in PHP & [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework) in Java.

The DI functionality is provided by the [Injecta Dependency Injection Container](https://github.com/pyfony/injecta).

Pyfony = **Injecta + bundles (extensions) API**
